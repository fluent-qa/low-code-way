# Fluent QA Statup Stack: Low Code Way

Over the years as Software QA, I have experienced a lot of tools in different categories.
Many of these tools provider too much functionalities which is too expesensive to learn and explore. I think most QA engineer may just use less than 20% of the whole functionalities provided.

After the improvement of dev language, framework and so on, the cost of devlop back-office service is decreased significant. The proof of the cost reduced is that the opensource tools, and low-code tools. I tried some of these tools, and find out , actually I can use different tools to replace different commercial tools. Why it works? In most cases, I only use the 20% of the functionalities.
Different little tools can provide these 20% functionalities with less cost. And most complex functionalities which can be replaced by in-house tools which is eventually developed, as it is highly organization related. 

After learning low code tools, I realized that Everything could be integrate, through:
1. API
2. Data Pipeline
3. Different Components 
4. ........


- So What ever you want to build, you need tiny thing in your pockets.
- So try to accumulate different libs, tools for different scenarioes.

## Product, tools or tiny spell

- office is a product, but it is too big to use, or you just use less than 20% the total features
- Tools is sometimes too complex to use, the learning cost is too big to learn
- tiny spell is good, but it is too hard to integrated.

So I think I need tiny spell libs and an easy integrated way to build up something in
a low cost way. 

How to build a easy integrated tools? 
- plugin framework for both frontend or backend
- easy to integrate API or pipeline
- easy to make a UI interface or CLI interface
