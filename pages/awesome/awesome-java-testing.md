* [Selenium](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium) - Testing framework for web applications. Understanding how it works is a must since it's under the hood in almost all modern UI testing libraries, but keep in mind that writing tests with pure Selenium will be much slower because of the boilerplate.

NB: In scope of UI tests since version [4.11](http://selenide.org/2018/04/02/selenide-4.11/) it's possible to use Selenide own proxy which is using Browsermob under the hood.
