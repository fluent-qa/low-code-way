Because all the department is using JIRA to track the whole development process, it is reasonable to leverage JIRA webhook to collect the operation data and build a mini data warehouse to get the whole metrics.The solution was plain simple:\nrecieve the webhook data, transfer it and save to a Database(mysql or postgresql what ever)\nBuild a dashboard or portal to visualize these data in different dimensions.\nProvide some flexibility to user to do ad hoc query or exploration to find new truth beyond the defined dimensions\nIt is not easy actually, why? I think the main reason is that most of development is not full stack developer, it needs:\nFront-end skill, either Vue or React\nDomain Expertise, at least understand what the meaning of different data\nBackend Skill, serve side coding skill, include api, batch job , SQL\nSo I think I need at least 2 Developers, one is front-end, another one is backend. But the resource which I have actually only 1 backend developer. How to solve it?Finally, after doing some research, I used a opensource BI tool like metabase to  solve it.And during the research, I also found some interesting topic like low-code-development, data pipelin platform,etc. Based on my experience, I think it is really good thing to small group to use these kind of techonlogy to reduce the cost of software development.I was a developer in testing. After I tried and found these tools, I realized that what developer in testing doing should be done in this way, low-code way. And not only a developer in testing should do it , but also all the tester should do it. The high salary of the developer in tester should be ended by low-code tools. Why? Because it reduce costs,and it works for me.And then I start the repo, and try to do more research.","product#Product":"[] whaller\n[] merge.dev","database-devops#Database Devops":"bytebase","low-code-products#Low-Code Products":"[]zorp\n[]builder","low-code-tools#Low-code Tools":"Following Low-code tools to hava a simple try:\nToolJet\n[*] docker\n[*] Create a Application\n[] docs/tutorial\n[] Rating file\nAppSmith\n[*] docker\n[] Create a Application\n[] docs/tutorial\n[] cubejs\n[*] docker\n[] Create a Application\n[] docs/tutorial\n[] NocoBase\n[*] docker\n[] Demo Application\n[] Nocodb\nnpx create-nocodb-app\n[] YaoApp\n[] docker\n[] Application\n[] Tutorial\n[] open metabase\n[*] Docker\n[] Application\n[] Tutorial\n[] supabase\n[] Retool\n[] JetAdmin\n[] Budibase\n[] DronaHQ\n[] NocoDB\n[] Baserow\n[] Frapper Framework\n[] Directus\n[] Convertigo\n[] Saltcon\n[]  ROWY\n[] Motor Admin\n[] Frappe\n[builder] (https://github.com/BuilderIO)","openapi-practice#OpenApi Practice":"openapi"}},"/awesome/go-lowcode":{"title":"Golang Low-Code","data":{"golang-framework#Golang Framework":"freedom"}},"/awesome/ops-low-code":{"title":"Ops Low-Code Tools","data":{"amdin#Amdin":"builda-admin","proxy#Proxy":"ngxinconfig-io"}},"/awesome/awesome-nocode":{"title":"Awesome NoCode / LowCode","data":{"":"awesome list from:\nawesome\nAwesome NoCode / LowCode\nTable of Contents\nAnalytics\nAutomation\nBusiness Apps\nChatbots\nCollaboration\nCRM\nData & Scraping\nDatabase\nDesign\nEcommerce\nEmail\nForms\nGames\nInternal\nLanding Pages\nMachine Learning\nMarketing\nMobile Apps\nPayments\nScrapers\nVideo\nVisual Programming\nVoice\nVR\nWeb Apps\nWebsites\nUncategorized\nTutorials\nLearning\nBlog Posts\nContribute\nLicense\nTutorials\nLearning\nBlog Posts","analytics#Analytics":"Google Analytics - Free website analytics.\nVisualSitemaps - Autogenerate Visual Sitemaps & Screenshots in Seconds\nSimple Analytics - Simple, clean, and friendly analytics.\nPosthog - Open source product analytics.","automation#Automation":"ActionDesk - The spreadsheet that lets you gather and control all your data in one place.\nAutomate.io - Put your business on autopilot.
