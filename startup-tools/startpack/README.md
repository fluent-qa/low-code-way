This is a basic setup of services for faster startup development. You can run it via [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) or [docker swarm](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/stack/).

Warning: This setup doesn't provide high level of security or any [high availability](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/what-is-high-availability). You have to hire some skilled devops engineer (like me)) for close this gap after getting first round or sales.

Also you can check [Awesome Selfhosted](https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted), [Awesome Sysadmin](https://github.com/kahun/awesome-sysadmin) and [Free for Dev](https://free-for.dev/) for more options ;)

And [Coolify](https://github.com/coollabsio/coolify) or [Dokku](https://dokku.com) - an open-source & self-hostable Heroku / Netlify alternative

## Setup

All operations should be executed from root on target machine. You can use your laptop or some server. For running all services you need at least 2 cpu cores, 8gb memory and 20gb of free disk space. You can find cheap servers on [hetzner.com](https://www.hetzner.com/cloud) or compare small hosters on [vps.today](https://vps.today/).

You also need a valid domain name pointed to this server for automatically setting up https with [traefik](https://traefik.io) and [letsencrypt](https://letsencrypt.org). However, you can [hack your hosts file](https://docs.rackspace.com/support/how-to/modify-your-hosts-file/) for working without https.

For bying domain and configuring DNS I recommend you [Cloudflare](https://dash.cloudflare.com). You should create at least two DNS record type `A`:
1) `your domain name` pointed to `your server IP`
2) `*.your domain name` pointed to `your server IP`

If you run services with `docker-compose`, all service will be located on your single server. With `docker stack` (swarm) mode, you can [add addition servers](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/swarm-tutorial/add-nodes/) in the same local network (the same network important for nfs volumes mounting unfortunately).

#### 1) Install docker if it doesn't installed
(run scripts from the internet is a bad practice, but if you don't know how to install docker with package managers - it's acceptable)
```
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
DRY_RUN=1 sh ./get-docker.sh
sh ./get-docker.sh
```

Install docker-compose
```
curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.29.2/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```

#### 2) [Setup docker swarm](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/swarm_init/) if you choose using it.
```
docker swarm init --advertise-addr $(hostname -I | awk '{print $1}')
```

#### 3) Get this repo
```
git clone https://github.com/tldr-devops/startpack.git --depth=1
cd startpack
```

#### 4) Fill necessary variables like domain name of your server, your email, passwords for basic auth and sql services.

Generate random passwords
```
echo -e "export NEXTCLOUD_SQL_PASSWORD=$(echo $RANDOM `date`|md5sum|base64|head -c 25)\n$(cat env.sh)" > env.sh
echo -e "export TULEAP_SQL_PASSWORD=$(echo $RANDOM `date`|md5sum|base64|head -c 25)\n$(cat env.sh)" > env.sh
echo -e "export STRAPI_SQL_PASSWORD=$(echo $RANDOM `date`|md5sum|base64|head -c 25)\n$(cat env.sh)" > env.sh
echo -e "export GITLAB_SQL_PASSWORD=$(echo $RANDOM `date`|md5sum|base64|head -c 25)\n$(cat env.sh)" > env.sh
echo -e "export OPENPROJECT_SQL_PASSWORD=$(echo $RANDOM `date`|md5sum|base64|head -c 25)\n$(cat env.sh)" > env.sh
echo -e "export NOCODB_SQL_PASSWORD=$(echo $RANDOM `date`|md5sum|base64|head -c 25)\n$(cat env.sh)" > env.sh
echo -e "export REGISTRY_PASSWORD=$(echo $RANDOM `date`|md5sum|base64|head -c 25)\n$(cat env.sh)" > env.sh
echo -e "export SQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=$(echo $RANDOM `date`|md5sum|base64|head -c 25)\n$(cat env.sh)" > env.sh
echo -e "export PASSWORD=$(echo $RANDOM `date`|md5sum|base64|head -c 25)\n$(cat env.sh)" > env.sh
```

You should change this lines with your email and dns name
```
echo -e "export EMAIL='Type your email here'\n$(cat env.sh)" > env.sh
echo -e "export DOMAIN='Type your domain here'\n$(cat env.sh)" > env.sh
```

This is your credentials, store it in your password manager ;)
```
cat env.sh
```

#### 5) Prepare environment
```
source env.sh
bash setup.sh
```

If you have docker swarm setup with more than one machine, you should start NFS server on main manager and [connect other nodes to it](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-mount-an-nfs-share-in-linux/):

A) On main machine
```
# Setup NFS server with compose as docker-swarm still doesn't support `privileged` mode
docker-compose -f nfs.yml up -d
```

B) On all other machines
```
export MASTER_IP="your $MASTER_IP from step 4"
export DATAPATH="your $DATAPATH from step 4"
echo -e "$MASTER_IP:$DATAPATH $DATAPATH nfs nfsvers=4,rw 0 0" >> /etc/fstab
mount $DATAPATH
```

#### 6) Run your new services

After entering all commands below you'll able to login into your new services by addresses:
* https://traefik.your_domain user `your $USERNAME` password `your $PASSWORD`
* https://portainer.your_domain
* https://registry.your_domain user `your $REGISTRY_USERNAME` password `your $REGISTRY_PASSWORD`
* https://influxdb.your_domain user `your $USERNAME` password `your $PASSWORD`
* https://grafana.your_domain user `your $USERNAME` password `your $PASSWORD`
* https://victoriametrics.your_domain user `your $USERNAME` password `your $PASSWORD`
* https://adminer.your_domain user `your $USERNAME` password `your $PASSWORD`
* https://minio-console.your_domain user `your $USERNAME` password `your $PASSWORD`
* https://gitlab.your_domain user `root` password `your $PASSWORD`
* https://nextcloud.your_domain user `your $USERNAME` password `your $PASSWORD`
* https://tuleap.your_domain user `admin` password `your $PASSWORD`
* https://openproject.your_domain user `admin` password `admin`
* https://rocketchat.your_domain
* https://vaultwarden.your_domain/admin password `your $PASSWORD`
* https://nocodb.your_domain
* https://strapi.your_domain
