# Fluent QA Stack: Low Code Way

This site is focused on introducing different practical tools, methodologies. I believe most process and tools should be simple, straightforward. All the tools, methodologies should be for solving real issues but not complex conceptions. All the fancy conceptions brings too much confusion.

Let's do it by cases and examples to see what kind of problem should be solved in a cost-saving way.


After the improvement of my dev languages skills, framework knowledge, the cost of develop a back-office service is decreased significant. The proof of the cost reduced is that the open-source tools, and low-code tools. I tried some of these tools, and find out , actually I can use different tools to replace different commercial tools. 

Why it works? In most cases, I only use the 20% of the functionalities. Different tiny tools can provide these 20% functionalities with less cost. And most complex functionalities which can be replaced by in-house tools which is eventually developed, as it is highly organization/company related.
